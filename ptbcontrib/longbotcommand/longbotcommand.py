This module contains a subclass for the BotCommand class
that allows for a longer description (e. g. for /help purposes).

class LongBotCommand(BotCommand):
    """
    Allows for a longer description (>256 characters) to be stored alongside
    the shorter one allowed for :class:`telegram.BotCommand` by Telegram's API limit.
    Passing this to `set_my_commands` ignores `long_bot_description`.

    Args:
        command (:obj:`str`): The command's handle, pass exactly like
            handle to :class:`telegram.BotCommand`
        description (:obj:`str`): The command's description, pass exactly like
            description to :class:`telegram.BotCommand`
        long_description (:obj:`str`, optional): The command's longer description,
            pass like description to :class:`telegram.BotCommand`. Defaults to ``None``,
            in which case the short description is duplicated as the long one.

    Attributes:
        long_description (:obj:`str`): The command's longer description.
