async def get_chat_link(chat: Chat) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Gets a link for the chat in the following order if the link is valid:
     1. Chat's link (`chat.link`).
     2. Chat's invite link (`chat.invite_link`).
     3. Chat's invite link from bot (`bot.get_chat(chat.id).invite_link`)
     4. Export primary invite link (`bot.export_chat_invite_link`).
     5. ``None`` since there is no valid link and the bot doesn't have permission
        to create one either.

    This function doesn't check to see if the bot has enough permissions to create/export
    invite links. Instead, it makes the API call and relies on the response (new link or
    error message) to determine the outcome. This way we can avoid an extra API call.

    Warning:
        This function might make up to 2 API calls to get a valid chat link.

    Args:
        chat (:obj:`telegram.Chat`): The chat to get a link from.

    Returns:
        :obj:`Optional[str]`: Chat link as a URL if there is any. Otherwise None.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If there is no bot associated with the ``chat``, :meth:`Chat.get_bot` raises
            a :exc:`RuntimeError`.
